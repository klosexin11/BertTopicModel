I can't have it on my work computer and out of the way any longer because I can't get rid of this extraneous section of window. Please provide the original compact view option again. I realise some changes are made for the betterment of users, and the betterment of the product. As a premium subscriber and a phone number subscriber, I'm saying this change is not better. I use skype ALL the time. It's on my phone and active whenever I'm near wifi (which is almost all day and is every day!). It's on my tablet which is always on wifi. It's on my laptop and on my desktop - - mind you, it's always signed in as well. It is my primary source of keeping in touch with family back home in the US."
