1,Thanks Jen for reminding. It just slipped my mind. I will have the materials ready by Thursday. Do I need to share the slides/document before the meeting or just present?
2,"Hey Leads, 
  
 I would be taking the first trench of 2 weeks paternity leave starting Mar/15 till end of March.
 Team members have tasks assigned and I’ll have another round with the team by end of this week. Specifically for ‘Time Suggestions’, Vijit would start sending a weekly update soon.
  
 Please let me know if something needs my attention before next week. 
  
 Thanks,
 :) Ab"
3,"Sounds good, thanks!
 
 No problem on tomorrow -- although, full disclosure, I have a potential conflict that I'm trying to figure out. Hoping to have that sorted out by EOD today."
4,"Thank you, Poonam! Interns always bring some excitement to the team and I’m sure they’ll be happy to welcome them to the team.

5,"Hi Ali, can you please provide me with the requests per second for both msg and cal within the SIP ring?
  
 And what would you consider the “current” RAM/CPU consumption is for messaging and calendaring?
  
 And how much have you reduced the RAM footprint in the last 30 days or what you expect to see in SIP? I believe Akjol mentioned a 35-40% reduction for both services in MSIT.
  
 The reason I’m asking is I’m reporting this out to Perry in my deep dive on Mar17."
6,"I haven't been feeling well since I woke up, and need a bit of a break today to recharge. I'll be back at work tomorrow. 
 
 Thanks!"
7,"I requested to join the DL on 2/12 but I see the request is still at authorizing/approving status. Do I need to do something to move that along?
  
 Thank you."
8,"Hey Poonam,
  
 I recently entered the Principal band and my manager recommended that I reach out to you as I look for mentors who can help me through the transition. If you’re open to it, would it be okay if I scheduled some time on your calendar to grab a virtual cup of coffee and see if this would be a good fit?
  
 Thanks!"
9,"Thank you so much, Gaston ?? It worked. I unzipped the file and uploaded the two files (consumption-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and odinml.py) to the container.
 
 If you guys want to update the doc, there is one more part that needs updating. At the end of the doc for more detailed instructions two links are provided. But they don't work, and It gives the following error message when I open them.
 The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.
 
 Many thanks again for the prompt reply??
 
 Best,
 Shima"
10,"Hi Helen,
  
 Hope you are doing well,
  
 Can you please help me to set up my VM so I can be able to use ADF and run my jobs?
  
 Best,
 Shima"
11,"Thank you so much ?? I am very excited to join the team. Actually, Yan sent me the url today for mercury and I just tried a query to see what results will give me.
  
 Best,
 Shima"
12,"Thanks for the note @Jiayue! Looks like Joe is still out. @Caleb or @Jenna any chance you have some time in the next day or two to help with this? To summarize, we need a loading UI to show for TXP in the message list (see screenshot from Adam above). I saw your names as design POCs for our read/write squads and our comms squad, which is why you're the lucky recipients of this email ?? 
 
 
 Let's plan to disable service appointment in the message list for now so @Joe can handle it when he's back."
13,"Adding @Allie and @Jennifer as this came up in the mobile metaOS sync last week
 
 Right now, I think we have planned to showcase the mobile activity center at Build for iOS/Android, potentially in the context of reactions (if we believe rxns can ship in the following months) or perhaps in the context of other notification types (at mentions, doc mentions, etc). 
 
 As far as I know, we don't plan to do any reactions-specific announcements for mobile, as Lynn covered that at winter Ignite in Jan

14,"Hi Helen,
  
 Here is the information regarding how to donate your emails. 5-10 should be enough?? But no pressure!
  
 Thanks,
 Xin"
15,"Hello Qiaoyun,
  
 Thank you for the information. These columns were suggested by ODIN team when the IsRegular option was deprecated from Action View more than a year ago (and we were offered to take this script as an example ActionForRegularUser.script - Repos (visualstudio.com)).
  
 It will be helpful that if the documentation can also reflect this history so users like us who’ve been through different editions of Action view can keep track of what to do.
  
 Thanks,
 Helen"
16,"Hello Team:
 
 We are looking for crews that have built a tenant admin cmdlet (specifically set-organizationconfig) in the past as we finalize building ours for speedy meeting. Would love to pick your brain on something we are considering for planning. 
 
 Please directly reply to me with the cc ?? thank you! 
 
 Cheers,
 Doris"
